SHACL Dashboard - Functions Package

This package contains the core service modules for the SHACL Dashboard backend.
It provides services for loading and querying SHACL validation reports,
generating statistics and visualizations, and interacting with the Virtuoso database.

Modules:
    analytics_service: Analytics and reporting services
    dashboard_service: Dashboard metrics and monitoring services
    phoenix_service: PHOENIX explanation generation services
    validation_service: SHACL validation services
    virtuoso_service: Core database connectivity and query services
    homepage_service: Services for the main dashboard page and statistics
    landing_service: Services for loading RDF data into the Virtuoso database
    shape_view_service: Services for detailed shape inspection views
    shapes_overview_service: Services for shapes graph analysis and metrics
